# To-Do Manager

## Project Summary
This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is a to-do list manager
that allows a user to create and manage both projects and individual tasks.
This program is based around the current date that it's opened, which means the
same projects and tasks with default dates are pre-loaded each time the program
is refreshed and/or opened. This implementation was created to allow the program
to present all of its features and allow the user to experiment with its functions.

## Features to Implement/Improve
* Use the Web Storage API to implement a way for the user to store their data
